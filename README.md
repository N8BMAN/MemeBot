# MemeBot
Personal Discord Bot

I really doubt anyone else will find most of this bot useful as anything beyond an example.

**Utilizes the following libraries:**
- discord.py v0.0.2
- plexapi    v3.0.6
- requests   v2.19.1
- some other stuff I'm probably forgetting

**Cool Features:**
- http requests communicate with radarr api to add movie requests to plex library
- A whole bunch of random sound clip commands
- Some role hierarchy management stuff that's not useful for most discord servers

**Things to do:**
- comment code so it makes sense
- think of more useful features
